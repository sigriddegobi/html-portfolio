<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I enjoy working in quiet and reserved enviroments,
  where I’m not easily distracted or disturbed. Like any other
  human on the face of the earth today, I’m into music, TV shows,
  movies and books. My biggest character deviation is, every now
  and then, to put myself in situations like swimming, cycling and
  running in sequence, in order to win a normal finisher medal
  and a banana at the end: I’m an amateur triathlete.
